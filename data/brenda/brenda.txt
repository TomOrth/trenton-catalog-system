INTERVIEWER: Is it like a walk downtown now?
BRENDA: Uh if you tried to walk downtown now through the traffic and the people and the port it’s still a whole lot of people down there but it’s not um good.
INTERVIEWER: How so?
BRENDA: Lot of lot of young people hanging out and even old people hanging out with nothing to do.
INTERVIEWER: Mmhm.
BRENDA: And uh you can’t you can’t even really walk down the street (?) street. A lot of people don’t go downtown as much as they used to especially on uh like bigs days like the first of the month. You know anything about that?

INTERVIEWER: Right.
BRENDA: My my my paycheck (?). And everybody was downtown kinda dangerous but.
INTERVIEWER: Mmm.
BRENDA: It’s all right. It’s all right. The big ole (?) don’t bother me but.
INTERVIEWER: Why do you think that it has has changed like that?
BRENDA: You know why? Because of the economy.
INTERVIEWER: Mmm.
BRENDA: And because uh a lot of young people don’t have anything they don’t have no job. They don’t have nothing to do. We used to have car (?). We used to have skating rink. We used to have a lot of activities for the children uh even the young people and now there’s nothing so what they do they get in groups and they hang downtown. So that’s why.
INTERVIEWER: Right right.
BRENDA: Yeah. All all our things have been taken away from us and we have nothing.
INTERVIEWER: Mmm.
BRENDA: We have nothing for our kids here. Nothing. Well I’m I’m just glad I lived in that era because I had a good time.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah it looked like it would be a good time.
BRENDA: Yeah it was. It was nice and (?). You you didn’t have to worry ‘bout nothing. Everybody spoke to everybody. There was no cover fee. 
INTERVIEWER: Mmm.
BRENDA:We were all people.
INTERVIEWER: Mmhm.
BRENDA: Now it’s like a issue.
INTERVIEWER: Mmhm.
BRENDA: Yeah so I just stay home. Not all the time I don’t.
INTERVIEWER: Mmm yeah uh I looked a lot about uh the steel industry and how that was really uh forwarded the economy of Trenton and and.
BRENDA: Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: And when that declined you’re saying that it the uh the impact was felt throughout the city.
BRENDA: Um Trenton mostly is was more like a close town you know uh a close down to the community.
INTERVIEWER: Mmm.
BRENDA: It was our town. And then we all our our our our our uh activities was taken away from us. You know like I said car (?), the skating rink, things for us to do as a family. Even Romeo and Juliet is gone. I used to take my kid there when he did a good grade in school. Oh I’d tell him to go get a couple of his friends. We used to go to Romeo and Juliet and.
INTERVIEWER: What was that?
BRENDA: Um that was more on um Calhoun Street.
INTERVIEWER: Oh.
BRENDA: It was a restaurant.
INTERVIEWER: OK.
BRENDA: And he’d take like four of his friends and they had uh uh one of them big pizzas and they’d have (?) soda and I’m sitting over there with a pitcher of beer.
INTERVIEWER: Mmm.
BRENDA: I had a good time. But see uh people have nothing to do now so that’s why everybody go downtown because that’s still the hotspot and you can see everybody. You go downtown I guarantee if I go downtown right now and I say I’ll be back in fifteen minutes I’m not gonna come back because I’m down there. Everybody knows everybody.
INTERVIEWER: Still?
BRENDA: Hey what’s up how you doing? I ain’t see you in a long time.
INTERVIEWER: Hmm.
BRENDA: That’s all.
INTERVIEWER: Did you feel um it was a strong sense of community identity in terms of living in Trenton at the time?
BRENDA: Yep. Yep. Everybody knew everybody and we had to worry ‘bout nothing more (?). If you got hurt everybody would help you.
INTERVIEWER: Mmhm.
BRENDA: If you did something wrong your mother, neighbors and all you could (?) always down the street ‘til you got home. That’s how close we were.
INTERVIEWER: Do you feel that uh how is that now?
BRENDA: Uhh.
INTERVIEWER: A little different?
BRENDA: A whole lot different.
INTERVIEWER: How so?
BRENDA: Wah well one day I think that people my age it’s about those who could afford to have left town and the ones who can’t are still here and they don’t do anything. Now the young kids has taken over.
INTERVIEWER: Mmhm.
B And they’re disrespectful. They have no manners. They they’re raised by by parents that are. I’m glad I was raised in that era that I was raised in because I can tell my grandkids that we used to play hopscotch(?), jump over the can, hide-n-seek, doubledutch. These kids today can’t do nothing but (?). Oh I remember him John was a good guy. He go he got killed over there two two blocks away or something like that. You know they all have no.
INTERVIEWER: Different stories?
BRENDA: Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
BRENDA: They all have no good things. They they got um miserable things. I had (?).
INTERVIEWER: Mmm.

INTERVIEWER: Hmm.
BRENDA: Mmm Trenton is Trenton is damn you know Trenton makes the world takes.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah yeah.
 BRENDA: Ahahaha.
INTERVIEWER: You think that’s true?

INTERVIEWER: Mmm.
BRENDA: Mmhm. I think Trenton got. I don’t think we’re as poor as they say we are.
INTERVIEWER: Mmm.
BRENDA: There’s a lot of (?) in Trenton. We’re very historical.
INTERVIEWER: Right right.
BRENDA: And we’re the capital city.
INTERVIEWER: Right.

INTERVIEWER: Yeah yeah.
BRENDA: I ain’t going. I’ll leave but I’m always coming back.
INTERVIEWER: Mmhm.
BRENDA: And I’ve been here ever since. I think it was. I came back home ‘bout ten to fifteen years ago and I ain’t never going. 
INTERVIEWER: Mmm.
BRENDA: I ain’t going nowhere. Mmhm. (?)
INTERVIEWER: Um we’re also interested in where you think Trenton will head into the future. Uh after spending so much time in it.
BRENDA: Ah ah you know what I. You don’t want me to answer that aha. I I think it’s gonna. It’s it’s bad because our our kids are our future right now and the way of what’s going on in Trenton. Not wanting (?) and no jobs and no activities. It’s kinda bad as is so I think in another five to ten years it’s gonna be really bad.
INTERVIEWER: Hmm.
BRENDA: Unless something good happens to change. You know OK they have no jobs so they they’re selling drugs ‘cause they gonna provide for their families.
INTERVIEWER: Right. Somehow.
BRENDA: And then we have some who who haven’t been raised so they do (?) and hurt people.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah yeah yeah.
BRENDA: And it’s getting real bad with it. That’s the only thing I’m I’m afraid about Trenton is it’s gonna get worse.
INTERVIEWER: Hmm.
BRENDA: And what it is right now I’m (?) somebody or something happens to pull us back out.
INTERVIEWER: Hmm. Um would you say that right now within the downtown area there’s is there any art and culture going on?
BRENDA: OK now in the downtown well they got bookstores down there and you can go to a museum. Oh I love it. I take all my nieces and nephew to the museum.
INTERVIEWER: The state museum?
BRENDA: Oh watchu talking.
INTERVIEWER: I haven’t been. I was looking to go there.
BRENDA: What?
INTERVIEWER: Is it worth it?
BRENDA: It’s worth it let me tell you.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah?
BRENDA: My sisters they’re not into teaching their kids culture.
INTERVIEWER: Mmhm.
BRENDA: So I get all all the nieces and nephew and they they have a good show at the museum. I take ‘em all and go to the museum and there’s barracks downtown.
INTERVIEWER: Right.
BRENDA: The barracks. Yeah what? You gotta teach your kids some culture and that (?) statue.
INTERVIEWER: Mmhm.
BRENDA: I take ‘em and let learn them a little bit about history and stuff like that. I we was in the paper I was in the newspaper.
INTERVIEWER: Really?
BRENDA: Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: For what?
BRENDA: Front page. Martin Luther King Day we did a um we walked out in the rain for the march for Martin Luther King and I got all my little nieces and nephew by me and we made the front page.
INTERVIEWER: Wow.
BRENDA: Yeah. So yeah there’s a lot of good uh artwork and stuff going on still in Trenton. It’s just that a lot of people don’t take their kids a lot of people were arrested close to our museum up there.
INTERVIEWER: Hmm.
BRENDA: Where we have exhibits and stuff going on. Yeah and now we have our parades down that street. Used to be in the park but now it’s down that avenue.
INTERVIEWER: Hmm. Why do you think there’s uh like a sort of disinterest in the in going to the museum? Like your sisters.
BRENDA: Because kids have. Kids having kids but my sister and they all like well you know what some parents just don’t give a whole lot(?). That that’s what I feel about my sisters. They they were them. They like they time(?) but no you can’t do that. You gotta take the kids. Let the kids get some culture. You gotta let them know things so maybe I’m the auntie who gives out like that.
INTERVIEWER: Mmhm.
BRENDA: I take all of ‘em. (?). I even take ‘em to the soup kitchen to eat.
INTERVIEWER: Hmm.
BRENDA: But my sister get mad because you took my son to the soup kitchen? Yeah if something happen to you they know there to go to eat. Your help. I I I like to do a lot of things.
INTERVIEWER: Right right. How do you think that the arts and culture of Trenton could be improved now?
BRENDA: I don’t know. I don’t know. I think we need better leadership. I think we need people coming with new ideas to go back to this book the way it was.
INTERVIEWER: Mmm.
BRENDA: But more moderate. I mean I think they need to put up more uh they need things for them to do and that will bring ‘em all back. It’ll take (?) that um you know nothing to do.
INTERVIEWER: Right right.
BRENDA: You could take our pic. There was gonna be a movie built right downtown on Broad Street.
INTERVIEWER: Uh huh.
BRENDA: Near Perry. Near Friendship Church. They had.
INTERVIEWER: OK.
BRENDA: Started rebuilding a movie and they stopped. They didn’t never do what they supposed what they said they was gonna do. They never finished.
INTERVIEWER: Hmm.
BRENDA: So they might have ideas but they don’t do nothing so I don’t I don’t know. Like I know we need I think.
INTERVIEWER: It would be good. It would be good.
BRENDA: It would be I think it would bring ‘em back.
INTERVIEWER: Good for the neighborhood.
BRENDA: Yeah because you know once you get something like that started they say oh c’mon lemme let’s take our kids down there to that new movie downtown on Broad Street and then all the other kids and and their parents will go too you know.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
BRENDA: They were starting uh another building over here with something more creative for their kids.
INTERVIEWER: Mmhm.
BRENDA: Yeah people will do it but we don’t have it.
INTERVIEWER: Hmm.
BRENDA: If we have it I know I’d go. I’m taking my my grandkids and everybody else’s kids. That’s how I.
INTERVIEWER: Catch a show or something.
BRENDA: Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah yeah yeah.
BRENDA: That’s what you have to do. There’s nothing good for them to look at or be involved in uh huh.
INTERVIEWER: Hmm. So definitely a different place since back then huh?
BRENDA: Oh it it’s so different the change. It is really. This let me tell you know it it’s so different but I do remember this picture. I do remember that.
INTERVIEWER: Mmhm.
BRENDA: But it is. It’s a whole lot of different. It’s a whole it’s a whole new world.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
BRENDA: It’s a different world. And I will say it can go back to the old but more moderate you know?
INTERVIEWER: Hmm mmhm.
BRENDA: Yep.
INTERVIEWER: Um is it where you thought it would. Is.
BRENDA: I mean.
INTERVIEWER: Is Trenton now where you thought it would be?
BRENDA: No I never thought Trenton would go down like this. Never but you know it’s a whole lot of different things that made it go down. I’d say that uh I think Trenton dropped(?) a lot and worked out a lot and we have no more memories. My memories now as an adult is careless. You can’t walk the street unless you get mugged. That’s my memory now as an adult but my memory as a child.
INTERVIEWER: Right.
BRENDA: (?) (?) (?). Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah it’s interesting.
BRENDA: Yeah so um and besides uh (?), my kids, my son and my grandkids are grown adults. Because I woudn’t live here with them. Uh I would move. I would probably move with my sister or something because it it’s not it’s no place to to raise. There’s no role models. There’s nothing you know? There’s nothing but destruction evil things. And the peer pressure this this time is bad because of the drugs. 
INTERVIEWER: Hmm.
BRENDA: So you know I wouldn’t I wouldn’t.
INTERVIEWER: Do you remember there being gangs in the in the between ‘45 and ‘665?
BRENDA: Back in my day? No. Whah? There’s wasn’t gangs back in my day. We didn’t know what that was. What was a gang? What is a blood? What is a crip? We didn’t know what that was.
INTERVIEWER: Really?
BRENDA: We had we had good times back in my day.
INTERVIEWER: Hmm.
BRENDA: Mmhm.
INTERVIEWER: That’s good to know.
BRENDA: Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: Um and I guess to stay on in terms of the future what else would be good for the community more broadly in terms of Trenton as a whole?
