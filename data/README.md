# Data instructions

The general format is each folder is for one transcript.

Each folder will have:
* 2 .txt files - One with the same name as the folder that holds the raw text file data, second is `data.txt` that contains the meta data related to the transcripts
* A .pdf file that is the original transcript file
* A `csv` folder that holds the prepared csv files for insertion via the COPY command

Since the transcripts are big, there is a need to format the data.
