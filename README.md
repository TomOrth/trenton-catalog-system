# CSC 315 Project Group 1 Transcript Catalog

This repository contains documents, database design, and code related to Group 1's implementation to house the transcripts from the trentoniana. As we progress
more in the stages, more of these readme sections will be filled out.

In addition to our README, please visit our wiki for more information.

# Technology

The database used will be postgres. The back-end server will be made with Python and Flask. The front-end will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Installation and Setup

We will put steps to setup the project as it is developed

# Database Design

Once the database design is finished in Stage III, we will describe and link it here.

# Contributing 

This section is for CSC 315 students who may continue to work on this after the original developers (if this project remains private) 
or for general developers who want to contribute (if this project is open sourced after the Spring 2021 semester).

Once the project is at a stable point, this section will contain that information
